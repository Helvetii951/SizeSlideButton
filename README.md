A fun Swift UIControl for picking a size.
![Demo Animation](../assets/demo.gif?raw=true)

## Features and Customization
+ `currentSize` to obtain the size the person has selected
+ `handlePadding` sets the padding around the handle (default is the left side's radius). Works best as <= leftSideRadius
+ `handle.color` is the slider's handle color
+ `trackColor` is the color of the track
+ `value` is a value between 0 and 1.0 of where the handle was positioned relative on the track
+ `leftSideRadius` and `rightSideRadius` return the radii of the left and right sides of the frame when expanded
+ `currentState` returns if the control is condensed or expanded

## Supported UIControlEvents
+ `TouchUpInside` is called when a tap on the control is released
+ `ValueChanged` is called when the slider is moved
+ `TouchDown` is called both when a long press is detected or a regular touch is detected
+ `TouchDragFinished` (A custom UIControlEvent) is called when the slider has selected a new value and been released
 

## Examples
```Swift
let condensedFrame = CGRect(x: 280, y: 70, width: 32, height: 32) //Width and Height should be equal
let fancyControl = SizeSlideButton(condensedFrame: condensedFrame)

fancyControl.trackColor = UIColor(red: 38/255, green: 50/255, blue: 56/255, alpha: 1)
fancyControl.handle.color = UIColor.whiteColor()
fancyControl.addTarget(self, action: #selector(newSizeSelected), forControlEvents: .TouchDragFinished)
fancyControl.addTarget(self, action: #selector(sizeSliderTapped), forControlEvents: .TouchUpInside)
self.view.addSubview(fancyControl)


func newSizeSelected(sender: SizeSlideButton){
    //Do something once a size is selected and the control let go
    // You can now use the senders .value as a multiplier for size
    print("Value: \(sender.value)")
}

func sizeSliderTapped(sender: SizeSlideButton){
    //Do something when the button is tapped
 }
```
